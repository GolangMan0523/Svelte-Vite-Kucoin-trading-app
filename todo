- Websockets
  add auto-reconnect support if connection lost
  add abstraction logical for Websocket.addListener, because:
    1) i can not kill callbacks after unsubscribing 
    2) there are a lot of CPU cycles being repeted (all subscibe will subscribe to all topic events)

- Charts
  add volume
  sub to a ws that pushes candles
  update last candle with fresh price and volume from match websockets (that is being used in recenttrades)

- General
  mb need to add throttle to chart, OrderBook, list because the data is being pushed too frequently

- tabs store
  fix a bug where it replaces current tabs's data instead of right tabs


- orderbook
  I need to connect to websocket feed, and when I have at least one change, request full orderbook, then apply cached changes to the orderbook, then as usual
